I've been warning people for years! The proof that I wasn't wrong! :D
<h1 class="title">Spreadsheets and the Financial Collapse</h1>

global financial system. We provide governments and regulating
authorities with some simple recommendations to reduce the risks of
continued overdependence on [..] spreadsheets.

P.D.: I hope this time censorship doesn't prevent this from publication, as in yesterday's post ;). Is there a problem with the wp installation? Sometimes it complains about missing folders, it takes you back and forth from argoblog to devblog. Yesterday I thought a post of mine would appear, but now it is as if it never existed.
