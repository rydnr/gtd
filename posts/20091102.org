* Tool to draw diagrams

I feel like I'm sending spam, but...

I found a website that allows you to draw diagrams online, with a Flash application. It's like a featureless version of Visio or Dia, but it provides nicer stencils and icons. At least, I get nicer results in my diagrams than what I'm used to.

The drawback: the free version only supports "I'm going to do it all before I leave" *, only one diagram at a time, and a watermark when you export it as png/jpg (which can be removed manually in Gimp or even automatically with ImageMagick).

Here's an example of what you can expect with the tool.

* Maybe because I've been using a 'bugmenot' account, and therefore all work gets discarded.

I almost forgot :), the website is <a title="LovelyCharts.com" href="http://www.lovelycharts.com" target="_blank">http://www.lovelycharts.com</a> (not a very fortunate name in my opinion).

P.D.: The image is too small. Maybe you can access it <a href="https://trac/attachment/wiki/Proval_TechDoc/Proval%20%28Network%20diagram%29.png" target="_blank">here</a>.
