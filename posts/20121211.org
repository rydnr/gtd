From <a href="http://www.yougotrickrolled.com" title="http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/" target="_blank">http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/</a> :



<blockquote>Programmer Dvorak is a "sub"-layout which makes it easier to write source code in C, C#, Java, Pascal, Lisp, CSS, XML and alikes. It was generated through reflection of the most common constructs in these languages and the rules set forward by the August Dvorak in his research, then verified by scanning through thousands of source code lines ensuring that a good fit was found. </blockquote>
