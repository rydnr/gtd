* Twitter for something serious

I'm wondering... What if we implement the following variation of 1-click buy?
1) We ask the customer to provide his Twitter/identi.ca/quora nick.
2) We add ourselves (t24/v24 twitter account) as followers of such account.
3) We parse customer tweets: if it contains something like $t24:eu:12,44,23,41,8,3#1,2, we (conceptually) fill a shopping cart with given bet. Or it could be just $t24:eu and we'll use a random/optimized bet.
4) We send an email asking the customer to confirm the purchase.
5) The customer clicks and the operation is accomplished the usual way.

Twitter is not exactly the same case as SMS, but nowadays with the absolute indifference people manage their privacy, I think it's pretty much the same. Nobody would probably care much about whether their bets are public. And we always could tie the purchase to his/her 'preferred' bet...
